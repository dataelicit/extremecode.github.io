# Data Type
*Data Types are an important concept of statistics, which needs to be understood, to correctly apply statistical measurements to your data and therefore to correctly conclude certain assumptions about it. This blog post will introduce you to the different data types you need to know, to do proper exploratory data analysis (EDA), which is one of the most underestimated parts of a machine learning project*

## Introduction to Data Types
Having a good understanding of the different data types, also called measurement scales, is a crucial prerequisite for doing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), since you can use certain statistical measurements only for specific data types.

You also need to know which data type you are dealing with to choose the right visualization method. Think of data types as a way to categorize different types of variables. We will discuss the main types of variables and look at an example for each. We will sometimes refer to them as measurement scales.

### Categorical Data
Categorical data represents characteristics. Therefore it can represent things like a person’s gender, language etc. Categorical data can also take on numerical values (Example: 1 for female and 0 for male). Note that those numbers don’t have mathematical meaning.

#### Nominal Data
Nominal values represent discrete units and are used to label variables, that have no quantitative value. Just think of them as „labels“. Note that nominal data that has no order. Therefore if you would change the order of its values, the meaning would not change. You can see two examples of nominal features below:

The left feature that describes a persons gender would be called „dichotomous“, which is a type of nominal scales that contains only two categories.
