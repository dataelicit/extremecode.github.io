# Gradient Descent
<img src="./images/descriptive1.png" alt="data" class="inline"/>

Gradient Descent is one of the most used algorithms in Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

It is an optimization algorithm used in training a model. In simple words, Gradient Descent finds the parameters that minimize the cost function (error in prediction). Gradient Descent does this by iteratively moves toward a set of parameter values that minimize the function, taking steps in the opposite direction of the gradient
