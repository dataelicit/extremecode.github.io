# Deep Learning

_Deep Learning has received a lot of hype in recent years due to its impressive performance on many applications, including language translation, medical diagnosis from X-rays, recognizing images to help with self-driving cars, beating the top Go players as well as beating high-ranking DotA players, learning how to play Atari games just from the pixel data… all these to name a few of Deep Learning’s recent accomplishments! In this post, we will (gently) introduce you to the inner workings behind Deep Learning at an intuitive level._

## **What is Machine Learning? And how is Machine Learning any different from “traditional algorithms”?**
### traditional Approach
If you’ve taken a class on algorithms, the standard metaphor for an algorithm is a recipe. An algorithm is a series of steps, that when performed in a specific order, produced your desired output. A “cooking algorithm” for a robot to make bread might go something like this:
Add to a large bowl 3 cups of flour, 1 tablespoon of salt and 3 tablespoons of sugar.
In a separate bowl, dissolve 1 package of yeast in warm water.
Combine the two bowls and knead for 10 minutes.
And so on… (I’m not a bread expert, so I shan’t write a recipe for bread here)
### ML Approach
In Machine Learning, we don’t specify the algorithm the way we did above. Rather, we specify the template (or the “architecture”) on what shape the cooking recipe might take:
Add to a large bowl __ cups of flour, __ tablespoon of salt and __ tablespoons of sugar.
In a separate bowl, dissolve __ package of yeast in warm water.
Combine the two bowls and knead for __ minutes.
