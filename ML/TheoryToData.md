# statistics


## Why study statistics?

1.	Data are everywhere
2.	Statistical techniques are used to make many decisions that affect our lives
3.	No matter what your career,  you will make professional decisions that involve data. An understanding of statistical methods will help you make these decisions efectively


## Applications of statistical concepts in the business world

*	Finance – correlation and regression, index numbers, time series analysis
*	Marketing – hypothesis testing, chi-square tests, nonparametric statistics
*	Personel – hypothesis testing, chi-square tests, nonparametric tests
*	Operating  management – hypothesis testing, estimation, analysis of variance, time series analysis

## statistics
*	The science of collectiong, organizing, presenting, analyzing, and interpreting data to assist in making more effective decisions
*	Statistical analysis – used to manipulate  summarize, and investigate data, so that useful decision-making information results.

### types
#### Descriptive statistics
Methods of organizing, summarizing, and presenting data in an informative way
#### Inferential statistics  
The methods used to determine something about a population on the basis of a sample
*	Population –The entire set of individuals or objects of interest or the measurements obtained from all individuals or objects of interest
*	Sample – A portion, or part, of the population of interest

A sample should have the same characteristics as the population it is representing.
Sampling can be:

*	with replacement: a member of the population may be chosen more than once (picking the candy from the bowl)
*	without replacement: a member of the population may be chosen only once (lottery ticket)


Sampling methods:
Sampling methods can be:

*	random (each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected)
*	nonrandom

The actual process of sampling causes sampling errors. For example, the sample may not be large enough or representative of the population. Factors not related to the sampling process cause non                              sampling errors.
Descriptive Statistics
*	Collect data
*	e.g., Survey
*	Present data
*	e.g., Tables and graphs
*	Summarize data
e.g., Sample mean

## What is Data?
Data is a collection of facts, such as numbers, words, measurements, observations or even just descriptions of things.
Data can be qualitative or quantitative.
*	Qualitative data is descriptive information (it describes something)
*	Quantitative data, is numerical information (numbers).

And Quantitative data can also be Discrete or Continuous:
•	Discrete data can only take certain values (like whole numbers)
•	Continuous data can take any value (within a range)
Put simply: Discrete data is counted, Continuous data is measured

### what data do

Census or Sample
* A Census is when we collect data for every member of the group (the whole "population").
* A Sample is when we collect data just for selected members of the group.
* A census is accurate, but hard to do. A sample is not as accurate, but may be good enough, and is a lot easier.
We collect data by doing a Survey.

Here are four steps to a successful survey:
*	Step one: create the questions
*	Step two: ask the questions
*	Step three: tally the results
*	Step four: present the results
You can also summarise the results using statistics, such as Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation and Quartiles

### Accuracy
Accuracy is how close a measured value is to the actual (true) value

### Precision
Precision is how close the measured values are to each other.

#### Examples of Precision and Accuracy:

So, if you are playing soccer and you always hit the left goal post instead of scoring, then you are not accurate, but you are precise!

#### Note -- to remember
*	aCcurate is Correct (a bullseye).
*	pRecise is Repeating (hitting the same spot, but maybe not the correct spot)

### Bias (don't let precision fool you!)
When we measure something several times and all values are close, they may all be wrong if there is a "Bias"
Bias is a systematic (built-in) error which makes all measurements wrong by a certain amount

#### Examples of Bias
*	The scales read "1 kg" when there is nothing on them
*	You always measure your height wearing shoes with thick soles.
*	A stopwatch that takes half a second to stop when clicked
In each case all measurements are wrong by the same amount. That is bias.

#### 2 Numbers
```markdown
With just 2 numbers the answer is easy: go half-way between.
Example: what is the central value for 3 and 7?
Answer: Half-way between, which is 5.
 
You can calculate it by adding 3 and 7 and then dividing the result by 2:
(3+7) / 2 = 10/2 = 5
```
#### 3 or More Numbers
```markdown
You can use the same idea when you have 3 or more numbers:
Example: what is the central value of 3, 7 and 8?
Answer: You calculate it by adding 3, 7 and 8 and then dividing the results by 3 (because there are 3 numbers):
(3+7+8) / 3 = 18/3 = 6
```
