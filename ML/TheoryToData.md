## Why study statistics?

1.	Data are everywhere
2.	Statistical techniques are used to make many decisions that affect our lives
3.	No matter what your career,  you will make professional decisions that involve data. An understanding of statistical methods will help you make these decisions efectively


## Applications of statistical concepts in the business world

*	Finance – correlation and regression, index numbers, time series analysis
*	Marketing – hypothesis testing, chi-square tests, nonparametric statistics
*	Personel – hypothesis testing, chi-square tests, nonparametric tests
*	Operating  management – hypothesis testing, estimation, analysis of variance, time series analysis

## statistics
*	The science of collectiong, organizing, presenting, analyzing, and interpreting data to assist in making more effective decisions
*	Statistical analysis – used to manipulate  summarize, and investigate data, so that useful decision-making information results.

### types
#### Descriptive statistics
Methods of organizing, summarizing, and presenting data in an informative way
#### Inferential statistics  
The methods used to determine something about a population on the basis of a sample
*	Population –The entire set of individuals or objects of interest or the measurements obtained from all individuals or objects of interest
*	Sample – A portion, or part, of the population of interest

A sample should have the same characteristics as the population it is representing.
Sampling can be:

*	with replacement: a member of the population may be chosen more than once (picking the candy from the bowl)
*	without replacement: a member of the population may be chosen only once (lottery ticket)


Sampling methods:
Sampling methods can be:

*	random (each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected)
*	nonrandom

The actual process of sampling causes sampling errors. For example, the sample may not be large enough or representative of the population. Factors not related to the sampling process cause non                              sampling errors.
Descriptive Statistics
*	Collect data
*	e.g., Survey
*	Present data
*	e.g., Tables and graphs
*	Summarize data
e.g., Sample mean

## What is Data?
Data is a collection of facts, such as numbers, words, measurements, observations or even just descriptions of things.
Data can be qualitative or quantitative.
*	Qualitative data is descriptive information (it describes something)
*	Quantitative data, is numerical information (numbers).
