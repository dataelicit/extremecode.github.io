# Sign Test

The sign test is a statistical test to compare the sizes of two groups. It is a non-parametric or “distribution free” test, which means the test doesn’t assume the data comes from a particular distribution, like the normal distribution. The sign test is an alternative to a one sample t test or a paired t test. It can also be used for ordered (ranked) categorical data.

The null hypothesis for the sign test is that the difference between medians is zero.

For a one sample sign test, where the median for a single sample is analyzed, see: One Sample Median Tests.
