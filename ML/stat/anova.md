## use cases
An ANOVA test is a way to find out if survey or experiment results are significant. In other words, they help you to figure out if you need to reject the null hypothesis or accept the alternate hypothesis. Basically, you’re testing groups to see if there’s a difference between them. Examples of when you might want to test different groups:

* A group of psychiatric patients are trying three different therapies: counseling, medication and biofeedback. You want to see if one therapy is better than the others.
* A manufacturer has two different processes to make light bulbs. They want to know if one process is better than the other.
Students from different colleges take the same exam. You want to see if one college outperforms the other
