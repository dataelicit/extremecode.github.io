# Chat Bots

## two variants of chatbots
* [Rule-based approach](#rba)
* [Self-learning bots](#slb)

### Rule-based approach <a name="rba"></a>
In a Rule-based approach, a bot answers questions based on some rules on which it is trained on. The rules defined can be very simple to very complex. The bots can handle simple queries but fail to manage complex ones.

### Rule-based approach <a name="slb"></a>
Self-learning bots are the ones that use some Machine Learning-based approaches and are definitely more efficient than rule-based bots. These bots can be of further two types: Retrieval Based or Generative
