* Jasmine
_Jasmine is a javascript testing framework that supports a software development practice called
Behaviour Driven Development, or BDD for short. It’s a specific flavour of Test Driven Development
(TDD).</br>
Jasmine, and BDD in general, attempts to describe tests in a human readable format so that nontechnical
people can understand what is being tested. However even if you are technical reading
tests in BDD format makes it a lot easier to understand what’s going on_
