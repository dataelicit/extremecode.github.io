### IQR <a name="IQR"></a>
*	Q3-Q1 for even set – no middle value
*	Step 1: Put the numbers in order.
1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 15, 18, 19, 27.
*	Step 2: Find the median.
1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 15, 18, 19, 27.
*	Step 3: Place parentheses around the numbers above and below the median. 
Not necessary statistically, but it makes Q1 and Q3 easier to spot.
(1, 2, 5, 6, 7), 9, (12, 15, 18, 19, 27).
*	Step 4: Find Q1 and Q3
Think of Q1 as a median in the lower half of the data and think of Q3 as a median for the upper half of data.
(1, 2, 5, 6, 7),  9, ( 12, 15, 18, 19, 27). Q1 = 5 and Q3 = 18.
*	Step 5: Subtract Q1 from Q3 to find the interquartile range.
18 – 5 = 13.

### Continous vs Discrete <a name="cvd"></a>
_Discrete variables are countable in a finite amount of time. For example, you can count the change in your pocket. You can count the money in your bank account. You could also count the amount of money in everyone’s bank account. It might take you a long time to count that last item, but the point is — it’s still countable._
_Continuous Variables would (literally) take forever to count. In fact, you would get to “forever” and never finish counting them. For example, take age. You can’t count “age”. Why not? Because it would literally take forever. For example, you could be:
25 years, 10 months, 2 days, 5 hours, 4 seconds, 4 milliseconds, 8 nanoseconds, 99 picosends…and so on. You couldturn age into a discrete variable and then you could count it. For example:_
*	A person’s age in years.
*	A baby’s age in months.

### Range  <a name="range"></a>
Step 1: Sort the numbers in order, from smallest to largest:
7, 10, 21, 33, 43, 45, 45, 65, 67, 87, 98, 99
Step 2: Subtract the smallest number in the set from the largest number in the set:
99 – 7 = 92
The range is 92
That’s it!
Sample question 2: What is the range of these integers?
14, -12, 7, 0, -5, -8, 17, -11, 19
Step 1: Sort the numbers in order, from smallest to largest:
-12, -11, -8, -5, 0, 7, 14, 17, 19
Step 2: Subtract the smallest number in the set from the largest number in the set:
19 – -12 = 19 + 12 = 31
The range is 31.
That’s it!
Sample question 3: What is the range of the following times?
2.7 hrs, 8.3 hrs, 3.5 hrs, 5.1 hrs, 4.9 hrs
Step 1: Sort the numbers in order, from smallest to largest:
2.7, 3.5, 4.9, 5.1, 8.3
Step 2: Subtract the smallest number in the set from the largest number in the set:
8.3 hr – 2.7 hr = 5.6 hr
The range is 5.6 hr
